# **Particles Discovery Lab**

The goal of this exercise is to reconstruct decays of an unknown particle X (initial state) to 2 muons (final state). To achieve this goal, participants need to display histograms for the calculated mass of particle X and learn about fitting and subtracting background distributions from data.

Uncertainty propagation concepts are included at each step of the analysis. After isolating the signal distribution, participants will determine which particle they have discovered and compare its properties (mass and width) to known properties.

## **Get Ready**

* Have the **my_python** container ready. The steps to install Docker and create this container were mentioned on the pre-exercises.
* Git clone this repository inside the **my_python** container and ensure the following files have been created: **pollsf.py**, **MuonAnalysis.ipynb**, and **DoubleMuParked_100K.pkl**.
